## Architectural Decisions & Design Rationale

### Backend Architecture

1. Depdency Injection with Awilix
   - Rationale: Makes the system modular easier to maintain or replace in the future
2. Service-Repository Pattern
   - Rationale: Separation of concrn between service layer where business rules do in here. The repository layers handle database operations
3. Secure HttpOnly cookie for refresh token
   - Rationale:I am thinking of preventing XSS attacks.

### Frontend Architecture

1. Separation of concern of server state and client state
   - Rationale: Tanstack query is used for all server state and zustand is used for global client state (auth status)
2. Feature grouping
   - Rationale: easy to add new feature, all you need to do is just to add a new folder and directly code id.

### AI Rationale

Github offers free AI models that developers could use to develop a generative AI application. For this application i am using
**OpenAI GPT-4o mini**

#### Rationale:

1. Could have 150 request per day
2. With copilot pro. I could have 8000 tokens in and 4000 tokens out per request
3. Easy integration. they offer a great documentation: <a href="https://github.com/marketplace/models/azure-openai/gpt-4o-mini">https://github.com/marketplace/models/azure-openai/gpt-4o-mini</a>

AI_ENPOINT="https://models.github.ai/inference"
MODEL_NAME="openai/gpt-4o-mini" # You can change this to your own model
```

### B. Download projcet

To get started with the server-side of the application, you need to have visual-studio code, Node.js and PostgreSQL installed on your machine. Furthermore, you need to have a folder. Inside that folder you need to:

1. **Clone the application from github**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/abrahamparn/TechnicalTestPointStar.git
   ```
2. **Install the dependencies**:

   ```bash
   cd .\TechnicalTestPointStar\server\
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up the database**:

   Create a `.env` file in the root of the `server` directory and add the following environment variables:

   ```
   DATABASE_URL="postgresql://<user>:<password>@<host>:<port>/<database>"
   ```

4. **Run the migrations**:

   Make sure you have a database ready. you don't need to add a table

   ```bash
   npx prisma migrate dev
   ```

5. **Start the server**:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

The server will be running on `http://localhost:3000`.

    ```

Additionals:
Outside of this test scope i also implemented several other endpoint for authenticaiton like

1. **`GET /api/v1/auth/getMe`**: return the current user's data.
2. **`POST /api/v1/auth/forgetPasswordEmail`**: send token for forget password for user.
3. **`POST /api/v1/auth/forgetPassword`**: change user password.
4. **`PATCH /api/v1/auth/updateUserData`**: change user data of name, username and phone_number.

## Authentication

The application uses JWTs for authentication. When a user logs in, the server generates a JWT and sends it to the client. The client then sends the JWT in the `Authorization` header of every request to the server. Furthermore, there should also be refresh token cookie and whenever jwt is expired, you can hit the refresh token to get a new access token.

The server uses a middleware to verify the JWT and protect the routes that require authentication.

## Database

The application uses a PostgreSQL database with Prisma as the ORM. The database schema is defined in the `prisma/schema.prisma` file.

The application uses migrations to manage the database schema. To create a new migration, you can use the following command:

```bash
npx prisma migrate dev --name <migration-name>
```

### Database situation

currently, we have two useable table for this project

1. Users table

   ```
   model users {
       user_id     Int       @id @default(autoincrement())
       email       String    @unique @db.VarChar(255) //important
       name        String    @db.VarChar(255) //important
       username    String    @unique @db.VarChar(100) //important
       password    String //important
       role        String    @default("user") @db.VarChar(100) //important
       is_verified Boolean?  @default(false)
       verification_token String? @unique //important
       verification_token_expires DateTime? //important

       last_login  DateTime? @db.Timestamp(6) //important

       created_at  DateTime? @default(now()) @db.Timestamp(6)
       updated_at  DateTime? @default(now()) @db.Timestamp(6)

       refresh_version Int       @default(0)
       password_reset_token   String?  @unique
       password_reset_expires DateTime?
       phone_number String?
       is_deleted Boolean? @default(false)
       is_deleted_time DateTime?
       version Int @default(1)


       notes   notes[] // Relationship with ntoes
   }
   ```

2. Notes table

   ```
   model notes {
       note_id   Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
       title     String
       content   String   @db.Text //for potentially long content

       //AI Feature
       tags      String[] // For tag generation
       sentiment String?  // For sentiment analysis


       created_at DateTime @default(now()) @db.Timestamp(6)
       updated_at DateTime @updatedAt @db.Timestamp(6)

       is_deleted Boolean @default(false)
       deleted_at   DateTime?                                // nullable

       // Relation: to user
       user      users    @relation(fields: [user_id], references: [user_id], onDelete: Cascade)
       user_id   Int

   }
   ```

## Logging

The application uses Pino for logging. The logs are printed to the console in a pretty format.

## Error Handling

The application uses a centralized error handling middleware to handle all the errors that occur in the application. The middleware sends a JSON response with the error message and the status code.

## Testing

The application uses Jest and supertest for testing. The tests are located in the `server/src/api/v1/auth/auth.test.js` directory. To run the tests, you can use the following command:

```bash
npm run test
```

Tools Used:

- supertest: for making HTTP assertions against the Express app
- jest: for mocking service methods and performing assertions

Environment Setup:

- A mock container (`req.scope`) is injected into the middleware to simulate service resolution
- Mocked services: `authService`, `env`

Routes Tested:

- [POST] /api/v1/auth/ → Register user
- [GET] /api/v1/auth/verify-email → Verify email with token
- [POST] /api/v1/auth/login → Log in user and issue tokens
- [POST] /api/v1/auth/refresh → Refresh access token from cookie
- [POST] /api/v1/auth/logOut → Log out user and invalidate refresh token

Test Coverage:

- Successful registration returns 201 and calls authService.register()
- Email verification returns 201 and calls authService.verifyEmail()
- Login returns 200, includes access token, and sets refresh cookie
- Refresh returns 200 and new access token
- Logout returns 200 and verifies refreshToken usage

# Client Documentation

## Overview

This is the frontend for the Smart Notes AI application, a modern, responsive web app built with React and Vite. It features full CRUD functionality for notes, a secure JWT-based authentication system, and an AI-powered summarization feature to enhance user productivity.

### Secure Authentication:

- User Registration with email verification.
- User Login with robust validation.
- Persistent sessions using a secure HttpOnly refresh token strategy.
- Protected routes for authenticated users.
- Public-only routes to prevent logged-in users from seeing login/register pages.

### Full Notes Management (CRUD):

- Create: Add new notes via a simple form.
- Read: View a list of all notes on the dashboard.
- Update: Edit existing notes in a modal dialog with validation.
- Delete: Remove notes with a confirmation prompt.

### AI-Powered Summarization:

- Instantly generate a summary of any note's content via a modal.
- Handles loading and error states gracefully.

### Modern User Experience:

- Fully responsive design for mobile, tablet, and desktop.
- Client-side validation with user-friendly error messages.
- Loading states for all asynchronous operations.
- Show/Hide password functionality for improved usability.

## Tech Stack

- Builtool -> Vite
- Framework -> React
- Styleing -> Tailwind CSS
- State Management -> Zustand and TanStack Query
- Routing -> React Router
- API Client -> Axios
- Form management -> React Hook Form and Zod

## Getting Startend

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18.x or later recommended)
- npm
- A running instance of the backend server.

### Installation

1. Make sure that you have read the backend documentation
2. go to client (from root directory)
   ```
   cd ./client
   ```
3. Install dependencies
   ```
   npm install
   ```
4. Make sure your vite.config.js is like this

   ```
   import { defineConfig } from "vite";
   import react from "@vitejs/plugin-react";
   import path from "path";

   import tailwindcss from "@tailwindcss/vite";
   // https://vite.dev/config/
   export default defineConfig({
       plugins: [react(), tailwindcss()],
       server: {
           proxy: {
           "/api": {
               target: "http://localhost:3000/api/v1",
               changeOrigin: true,
           },
           },
       },
       build: {
           outDir: path.resolve(__dirname, "../server/public"),
       },
   });

   ```

5. Run the development server
   ```
   Npm run dev
   ```

## Folder stucture

I tried to group by feature

```
src/
├── api/          # Centralized Axios instance and interceptors
├── features/     # Core application features, each as a self-contained module
│   ├── auth/     # Authentication logic, hooks, and components
│   ├── notes/    # Notes CRUD logic, hooks, and components
├── pages/        # Top-level route components
├── providers/    # Global context providers (React Query, Router)
├── routes/       # Routing configuration, including protected/public routes
├── store/        # Zustand store for global client state
└── lib/          # Utility functions

```

# How to run both of them

Now that you have setup your backend and front end. there is a simpler way to run them. which is to leverage the server/public/. you can go to /server
and do

```
npm run dev
```

you dont have to do the client and can directly go to

```
http://localhost:3000/login
```

## What if /server/public is not there?

well, you can go to the /client. and type

```
npm run build
```

i have setup the config to put the built result in public.
